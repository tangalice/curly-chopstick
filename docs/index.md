5.1 Notes: Beneficial and Harmful effects of computing
- Computing benefits society, program drones to have many uses(aerial search, hobbies, military usage)
- computing created applications and games that bring lots of pleasure to ppl (dopamine is released in their brains), they become addicted which is very harmful
- social lives, relationships and even healthy can be ruined (one man became so addicted to gaming he almost ruined his life before he finally chose to stop)
- automation can save time and money
- automated telephone trees save people money, don't have to hire ppl to interact with customers when a computer can handle them instead. Only when nesesscary is a human put on the line

Github Pages Action:
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing: <br>
Computing created self checkout machines. There is less need for human cashiers if a machine can do their job. This saves the employers money but it also takes people's jobs away. Computing created online math equation solvers. They can be beneficial in helping people do math more effeciently and check accuracy of people's work but it is also commonly used to cheat. Self driving cars can make driving more convienent but if it is involved in an accident it makes deciding who is liable more difficult. 
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?: <br>
Dopamine and addiction is real and not a parent conspiracy. If we do or experience something enjoyable, our brain does release dopamine, and we can get too attached/addicted. These dopamine issues impact everyone, including me. When dopamine is released when we do something we feel happy. So we want to keep on doing that same thing so more dopamine is released. But it the activity we are doing is not nesesscarly good then this issue becomes bad. Dopamine is released when I go on social media. This affects my success in high school because I go on social media too much to get that dopamine release. It has become an "addiction". 

5.2 Notes: The digital divide
- more impoverished areas have less access to technology, some countries (china, north korea) restrict people's access to the internet which also puts them on the other side of the digital divide
- contributing factors to divide are socioeconomic (money), geographic (location), demographic (education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity)
- individuals do not have access to the latest technology or updates
- some religious groups like the amish do not use technology, putting them on the other side of the divide
- some schools provide chromebooks to help bridge the divide but even then chromebooks cannot compete with some of the computers brought from home (cannot run powerful programs, some pages and actions are blocked)
- at school even computers from home have restrictions when on school wifi, routers block specific content and sites

Github Pages Action:
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?: <br>
Someone can empower themself in a digital world by making sure their technology is updated correctly or purhcase devices so they can have access to the internet and resources from online. Someone can also be empowered by doing some research so they know how to use the internt safely and to it's fullest potential. They can also do research about their device so they can utilize all of the tools and features that comes with it or can be downloaded. Even though its not possible for everyone to be on one side of the digital divide, those who do have the money to purchase a device, they can be more empowered by doing the above and being more educated on technology and how it works.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS: <br>
Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by donating money so that they can go and purhcase a device. Another way would be to donate devices to the not empowered. This way the not empowered can be more empowered by having access to the interent and resources that they did not have access to before. Another way someone empowered can help someone that is not, is by teaching them how to safely use their devices and the internt to its fullest potential. For example, if someone who previously did have a computer or email did not know to avoid clicking on random links from junk emails they could be educated on this from someone that is empowerd. They would learn this new information and be more empowered by avoiding getting a virus from the junk email. Something that could be done at Del Nrote Highschool is host a fundraisier or a device donation drive. The fundraised money and devices would be donated to those who are not empowered.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?: <br>
Red tape is blocking digital empowerment. You can use paper and still be digitally empowered. But with red tape it is a lot harder. At del norte, the school wifi network is a barrier. It blocks out many sites and content that can be useful to students learning. For example, in our very own computer science class, our deployed websites are blocked on school wifi. It is a huge barrier if students in del Norteâ€™s computer science classroom cannot access their own work at school. There are also red tape barriers elsewhere, such as North Korea. People there do not have free access to the internet
