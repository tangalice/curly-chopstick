Corrections:
- Q21 The World Wide Web is not a protocol, and the Internet is not a data stream. The Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.
- Q38 Statement II is correct because the repository of stored metadata includes time, so information about the time of calls can be analyzed to make predictions about future calls. Statement III is correct because the metadata stores the phone numbers of the two parties of a call. Given one phone number, the metadata can be processed to provide all phone numbers that were called by or placed to that person.
- Q46 Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.
- Q48 Removing the connections between C and F and between F and H will prevent devices A and F from communicating.
- Q49 The actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before.
- Q50 If a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored.

Corrections:
- Q14 The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

Corrections
- Q2 An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.
- Q17 The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [30, 40, 20, 10] the procedure returns 20, which is not the least value in the list. The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list [40, 30, 20, 10] the procedure returns 30, which is not the least value in the list.
- Q18 The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values.
- Q22 The fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating-point numbers) limits the range of floating-point values.
- Q23 The average number of characters per message appears to decrease after the mobile app was released.
- Q28 From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.
- Q35 If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA.
- Q42 Using 6 bits will only allow for up to 64 sequences because 2^6=64. Using 7 bits will allow for up to 128 sequences because 2^7=128. Therefore, a minimum of 7 bits are needed.
- Q46 This is an example of symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages.

Corrections
- Q7 Using 7 bits will allow for up to 128 employees (2^7=128)
- Q15 The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
- Q16 Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
- Q31 The game piece begins at the rightmost black space. The piece moves one space to the left to a yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 1. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to another yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 2. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to a green space, and the counter is incremented to 3. The piece then moves two spaces to the right to the red space, and the counter is incremented to 4. The algorithm terminates now that the piece is in the red space.
- Q38 This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.
- Q39 Using 8 bits will allow for up to 256 characters (2^8 = 256)
- Q43 The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.
- Q48 Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys.
